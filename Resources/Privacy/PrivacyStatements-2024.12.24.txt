# Privacy Policy

## Overview

SubZen is a privacy-first subscription manager that keeps all your data on your device. This policy explains our approach to your privacy and data.

## SubZen Team Privacy Policy

- **No Data Collection**: We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or usage data.
- **All Data Stays Local**: Your subscription data remains entirely on your device, stored in iOS sandboxed storage (UserDefaults).
- **No Telemetry**: We do not track usage, behavior patterns, or analytics.
- **No Crash Reports**: We do not collect crash reports or diagnostic data.
- **No Account Required**: SubZen works completely offline. No sign-up, no servers, no cloud.

## Network Usage

SubZen makes network requests only for:
- **Currency Exchange Rates**: We fetch real-time exchange rates from Frankfurter API (https://frankfurter.app) (European Central Bank data) to convert subscription costs across currencies. These requests do not include any personal information.
- **Offline Fallback**: If you're offline, cached rates (up to 24 hours old) are used automatically.

You can use SubZen entirely offline if all your subscriptions use the same currency.

## Third-Party Services

SubZen does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Data Security

- Your data is protected by iOS sandboxing and device encryption (when you enable passcode/Face ID).
- We do not transmit subscription details to any servers.
- Currency API requests only send currency codes (e.g., "USD", "CNY"), not your subscription data.

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- **Export**: Use iOS Backup to preserve your data when switching devices.
- **Deletion**: Delete the app to remove all stored data permanently.
- **Reset**: Use "Reset All Data" in Settings to clear subscriptions without uninstalling.

## Policy Updates

We may update this policy as new features are added. Updates will be posted in the app and on our GitHub repository.
